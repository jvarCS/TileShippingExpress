        <p>9. We would like to point out the following limitations:</p>
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- The system to recover from power failures contains bugs and may not fully work.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- During SIFT cases, there may be too many cells highlighted green as a result of improper path calculation. The operation should still be completed but potentially not as optimal as possible.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- The continue button during balance/transfer may not appear in some cases. When this happens, the user will have to click on the finish button which steps through the program until the final state is reached.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- Using the back button on the browser can result in the operation continuing despite the back button being clicked. 
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- Using the back button on the browser may disrupt the flow of the current operation resulting in an error.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- A system for cases in which a container must be carried above the grid is in place; however in test cases with stacked columns, the operation was not consistent in completion.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- The estimated cost for the transfer process displays the cost per step rather than the total time for loading and unloading. This also applies for when balancing requires more than 1 container to be moved.
        <p style = "text-indent: 30px">- Sometimes when a container is loaded on the ship, the program may skip the first column even when it is unused. The container will be lowered through the second column in this case.
